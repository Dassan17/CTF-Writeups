# CTF Writeups

This is my personal collection of writeups based on TryHackMe CTFs.  
Everything is written by me, so if you find something that is wrong or badly written, please let me know.  
All the files that you might need are in the same folder as the writeup.

I decided to publish one writeup every week, but if you need help with a specific CTF, feel free to send me a message.  
In this README I will explain, in my opinion, why, how, and when you should use writeups. I will try not to bother you, but you must read it.

### My journey with CTFs

I started my journey with CTFs during my first year of high school and, like almost everyone, I started without knowing anything about cybersecurity or computer science.  
These challenges were way too fun not to try. Since I didn’t even know where to start, I just searched on Google for solutions, and that’s how I discovered the world of writeups.

One of the most important lessons I learned from writeups is that **sometimes you should not read writeups.**
However, they are still important. That's why, since November, I have started taking CTFs seriously and begun writing my own writeups. My goal is to help the community and, in a way, write the guides that would have helped my past self.

### Why you should read my writeups (and why you should not)

I am writing these writeups for my past self:

- I did not know where to start.
- I did not know how to [Google properly](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/ip3cqa/the_hardest_part_of_learning_anything_is_knowing/).
- I needed a gentle push toward the solution.

If you just want to rush through CTFs as fast as possible so you can post them on LinkedIn, please reconsider your life choices.  

If you are stuck on a problem, Google it first. The ultimate goal of CTFs is to learn while having fun (sometimes you do not have fun, /s), so your best friend is Google.  
If you are using AI, please use it carefully. Do not just type: *“I have X and Y, give me the flag/key”*. Try to ask more general questions that help you understand what you are doing.

This is why I decided to organize my solutions with three hints before every crucial step, so **you** can learn more about the problem you are facing.  
Do not just scroll to the bottom to see the solution. Do it for yourself.
